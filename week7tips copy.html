    <p>Factors like elevation gain, rapidly changing weather, and the sun's intensity can make things a little bit different when hiking in Colorado compared to other places. Here are some tips to be prepared for on a Colorado hike:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be aware of altitude sickness. It is much harder to breathe at elevations around 7,000 feet and up because the atmospheric pressure and oxygen percentage decrease at a rapid rate. </li>
        <li> Be prepared for the weather to change quickly. Afternoon storms in the summer are common and can bring heavy rain, lightning and hail. Hiking early is best.</li>
        <li>Colorado has a dry climate and it is easy to become dehydrated. A good rule of thumb is to drink one liter of water every two hours while hiking. </li>
        <li>It's likely that you will encounter wildlife on your hike. Please remember these animals are wild and should not be approached. Stay calm, make your presence known, and keep your distance.</li>
        <li>With thinner atmosphere and higher elevation, the sun is intense! Wear sunglasses and plenty of sunscreen. </li>
    </ul>
